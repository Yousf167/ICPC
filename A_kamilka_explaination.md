The problem you're trying to solve is from Codeforces (Problem 2092A), which involves finding the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of any two elements in an array after adding some non-negative integer `d` to all elements of the array.

### Analysis of Your Approach
Your current approach involves iterating `d` from 0 to 100 and for each `d`, computing the GCD of all pairs of elements in the array (after adding `d` to each element), and keeping track of the maximum GCD found. While this might work for small values of `n` and small ranges of `d`, it is not efficient or guaranteed to find the optimal `d` for larger inputs. The time complexity of your approach is roughly O(T * I * n^2), where `I` is the number of iterations (101 in your case), and `n` is the size of the array. This could be too slow for larger inputs.

### Optimal Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we need a smarter approach. Here’s the key insight:

1. **GCD Property**: The GCD of two numbers `a + d` and `b + d` is the same as the GCD of `(a + d)` and `(b + d) - (a + d) = b - a`. This simplifies to `GCD(a + d, b - a)`. However, since `b - a` is fixed (it's the difference between the original array elements), the GCD will be a divisor of `b - a`.

2. **Optimal `d`**: The maximum possible GCD of any two elements in the array after adding `d` will be the maximum divisor (greater than 1) of the difference between any two elements in the array. If all elements are the same, then any `d` will result in the same GCD (which is the element + `d`).

3. **Candidate `d`**: The optimal `d` can be derived from the differences between the elements in the array. Specifically, we can consider the absolute differences between all pairs of elements and then consider all possible divisors of these differences as candidates for `d`.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Compute Differences**: Calculate the absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the array.
2. **Find Divisors**: For each non-zero difference, find all its divisors. These divisors are potential candidates for the GCD.
3. **Check Candidates**: For each candidate divisor `g`, compute the required `d` such that `(a[i] + d) % g == 0` for some pair. The optimal `d` will be the one that maximizes `g`.
4. **Handle Special Cases**: If all elements are the same, then the GCD is simply `a[0] + d` for any `d`. The maximum GCD in this case is infinity, but since `d` must be non-negative, the maximum GCD is `a[0] + d` where `d` is chosen to maximize this (but the problem likely expects the GCD to be as large as possible, which is unbounded unless constraints are given).

### Solution Code
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> a(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        
        // Check if all elements are the same
        bool all_same = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (a[i] != a[0]) {
                all_same = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (all_same) {
            // The GCD is a[0] + d; since d can be any, the maximum GCD is unbounded
            // But the problem might expect to choose d such that a[0] + d is as large as possible
            // However, since d can be arbitrarily large, the GCD can be made arbitrarily large
            // But likely, the problem expects to output 1 (since no pair with d=0 gives GCD a[0])
            // Or perhaps the problem has constraints not mentioned here
            cout << "1\n";
            continue;
        }
        
        // Collect all absolute differences
        set<int> diffs;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                int diff = abs(a[i] - a[j]);
                if (diff != 0) {
                    diffs.insert(diff);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Find all divisors of all differences
        set<int> divisors;
        for (int diff : diffs) {
            for (int g = 1; g * g <= diff; ++g) {
                if (diff % g == 0) {
                    divisors.insert(g);
                    divisors.insert(diff / g);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int max_gcd = 1;
        // Check each candidate divisor
        for (int g : divisors) {
            if (g <= max_gcd) continue;
            // Check if there exists at least two elements a[i] and a[j] such that (a[i] + d) % g == 0 and (a[j] + d) % g == 0
            // Which implies (a[i] + d) ≡ (a[j] + d) ≡ 0 mod g => a[i] ≡ a[j] ≡ -d mod g
            // So a[i] ≡ a[j] mod g
            // So we need at least two elements congruent mod g
            map<int, int> mod_counts;
            for (int num : a) {
                int mod = (num % g + g) % g;
                mod_counts[mod]++;
                if (mod_counts[mod] >= 2) {
                    max_gcd = g;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        cout << max_gcd << '\n';
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and processes each case individually.
2. **All Elements Same Check**: If all elements in the array are the same, the GCD can be made arbitrarily large by choosing a large `d`, but the problem likely expects a default output (here, 1 is chosen as a placeholder).
3. **Difference Calculation**: The code calculates all pairwise absolute differences between array elements.
4. **Divisor Collection**: For each difference, all divisors are collected. These divisors are potential candidates for the maximum GCD.
5. **Checking Valid GCDs**: For each candidate divisor, the code checks if there are at least two elements in the array that, when adjusted by some `d`, would both be divisible by this candidate. If so, the candidate is a valid GCD, and the maximum such value is tracked.
6. **Output**: The maximum valid GCD found is printed for each test case.

This approach efficiently narrows down the possible candidates for the optimal `d` by leveraging number theory properties, ensuring optimal performance even for larger inputs.
